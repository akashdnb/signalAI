## 2026-10-17 — Bootstrap entry

**Timestamp:** 2026-10-17 02:10 Asia/Kolkata (IST)

### Initial review findings

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `client/src/components/ui/README.md` first.
- The CSS consolidation audit found that `App.tsx` still imports `precision-operations-preview.css` alongside `app-shell-phase2.css`, `core-screens-phase4.css`, and `product-polish-phase5.css`. Meanwhile, `main.tsx` imports `index.css`, `precision-operations-production.css`, `precision-operations-workflows.css`, and React Flow CSS.
- Preview CSS contains 15 `--po-*` root/scope variables. Applying an exact semantic mapping in bulk is not safe before visual output and dark-mode contrast are verified.
- The live BrowserMCP comparison found that production `/leads` has real filtering for stage, qualification, handoff, activity date, sort/search, and Instagram account, plus 24 real leads and pagination. The live preview Leads screen uses sample data and simpler, different filters. Preserve all production behaviors.
- The login gradient should be treated as an intentional central-token decision, not an unreviewed page-level override.
- Production has not been deployed or changed.

### Next steps

1. Receive and review delegated audits.
2. Implement CSS consolidation in a reviewable PR.
3. Bring Leads and Automation to parity while preserving production behavior.
4. Address dashboard and analytics parity.
5. Perform QA at light and dark themes and supported widths.
6. Deploy only after all steps have been verified.

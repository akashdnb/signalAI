## 2026-10-18 09:32 UTC — [Independent VM Agent] Second production build gate correction

- The first type-safety patch was merged through PR #155 as foundation commit `f168deee77370220e209c929b134183acdaf9c84`. Render deploy `dep-dba93c6q1p3s73apnv00` checked out that exact foundation head but failed again on the same five Analytics TS2345 errors; the Content TS18047 filtered-media errors were resolved.
- Cause: the inferred alias `const currentTenantId = tenantId; if (!currentTenantId) return;` did not yield a stable `string` type in this repository's compiler configuration when captured by the async loader.
- Child branch `fix/analytics-tenant-build-guard` starts at `f168deee77370220e209c929b134183acdaf9c84` and explicitly performs the existing early guard first, followed by `const currentTenantId: string = tenantId;`. This gives the async closure a declared string while preserving the same tenant checks, API routes, selected-account filter, cancellation behavior, and auth redirect.
- The latest production deployment attempt failed before publication. Production continues serving the last previously-live successful deployment (`eaf50af2d38c04715a6b9b8016d9f87e1cc7f3bf`) pending another build attempt.
- This follow-up still needs to pass Render's `npm ci --include=dev && npm run build` gate. No merge/deploy success is claimed here. No `main` changes were made.

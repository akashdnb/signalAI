## 2026-10-18 09:32 UTC — [Independent VM Agent] Second production build gate correction

- The first type-safety patch was merged through PR #155 as foundation commit `f168deee77370220e209c929b134183acdaf9c84`. Render deploy `dep-dba93c6q1p3s73apnv00` checked out that exact foundation head but failed again on the same five Analytics TS2345 errors; the Content TS18047 filtered-media errors were resolved.
- Cause: the inferred alias `const currentTenantId = tenantId; if (!currentTenantId) return;` did not yield a stable `string` type in this repository's compiler configuration when captured by the async loader.
- Child branch `fix/analytics-tenant-build-guard` starts at `f168deee77370220e209c929b134183acdaf9c84` and explicitly performs the existing early guard first, followed by `const currentTenantId: string = tenantId;`. This gives the async closure a declared string while preserving the same tenant checks, API routes, selected-account filter, cancellation behavior, and auth redirect.
- The latest production deployment attempt failed before publication. Production continues serving the last previously-live successful deployment (`eaf50af2d38c04715a6b9b8016d9f87e1cc7f3bf`) pending another build attempt.
- This follow-up still needs to pass Render's `npm ci --include=dev && npm run build` gate. No merge/deploy success is claimed here. No `main` changes were made.

## 2026-10-18 09:34 UTC — [Independent VM Agent] Production deployment successful

- After the previous failed build, PR #156 was source-reviewed and squash-merged as foundation commit `19973f198756d6bc6bd5d65f0b5dd485493ae3f3`. This follow-up explicitly types the guarded tenant ID as `string`; the prior PR #155 fix keeps Content's filtered-media result non-null.
- Deployed exact foundation commit `19973f198756d6bc6bd5d65f0b5dd485493ae3f3` to Render production static site `signalai-bui` (service `srv-dan7dhjtqb8s73asu9u0`), deployment `dep-dba948lg1s2s73b8ckng`.
- Render status is `live`; the configured build command `npm ci --include=dev && npm run build` completed with Vite reporting `✓ built in 565ms` and Render reporting `Your site is live`.
- Post-deploy check opened the production dashboard URL in hosted Playwright. It redirected unauthenticated access to the expected `/login` route, and the login page rendered its sign-in options. An authenticated dashboard interaction check was not performed.
- Hosted Playwright tabs used for verification were closed; no agent-chat tabs were touched. Render still reports auto-deploy off, unchanged.
- npm install emitted an advisory that one high-severity dependency vulnerability exists. It did not fail the build and was not auto-fixed as part of the targeted type repair; follow-up dependency audit is recommended.
- No `main` changes were made. This entry records a successful production deploy; it does not declare the overall UI migration finished.

## 2026-10-19 00:15 UTC — [Independent VM Agent] Lead fields compact parity

- Fresh foundation/open-work reconciliation confirmed Lead Detail remains covered by PR #157, Analytics remains blocked by product/backend decision issue #149, and no open implementation PR covers Settings → Lead fields.
- Re-read the current foundation Settings fields source and shared UI guidance before editing. The production screen already preserves the real tenant-scoped field-definition API, create/delete workflows, and truthful live data.
- On child branch `style/settings-fields-compact-parity-20261019` from foundation `24ca13032d6588d0ca430990ae02e9f73056bd1e`, changed only `client/src/styles/settings-fields-parity.css` plus this bookkeeping entry.
- The focused change removes the per-row rounded/card treatment and restores a compact divider-based table hierarchy: business-facing Label remains primary, Technical key remains secondary, and Type/Remove remain quiet. This is intended to better match the preview's scan-first list without copying preview sample data or changing production behavior.
- BrowserMCP hosted Playwright preflight was attempted (`browser_worker_list_tools`, `browser_status`) but the non-interactive runtime rejected both with `User input required`; no rendered verification is claimed and no browser tabs were opened.
- Build/lint/test/CI were not available in this runtime; no green verification is claimed. No merge, deploy, or `main` change was performed.
